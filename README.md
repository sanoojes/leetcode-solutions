# My LeetCode Journey

This repository contains solutions to LeetCode problems I'm working on to improve my coding skills. I primarily focus on breaking down problems and exploring different approaches for efficient solutions in Java and Python.

**Goals (Optional):**

- Sharpen my problem-solving skills through various LeetCode challenges.
- Practice implementing algorithms and data structures effectively in both Java and Python.
- Prepare for technical coding interviews.

**Problem-Solving Approach**

I generally follow these steps:

1. Understand the problem clearly
2. Break down the problem into smaller subproblems
3. Design an algorithm and analyze its time and space complexity
4. Implement the solution in code (Java or Python)
5. Thoroughly test the solution with various inputs
